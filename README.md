This is a multi-threaded server developed for the purpose of enhancing adherence for patients with the need of physiotherapy. The server responds to user requests, produces daily exercise information, and a log of exercise summary in the past 7 days. The physiotherapists will be able to set goals for their patients, and the extent of exercises done versus the amount expected will be shown in percentage.
